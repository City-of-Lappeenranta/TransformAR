In addition, there is information about ongoing street works and free parking spaces.",
    "NOTICE_TITLE": "Input observation",
    "NOTICE_DESCRIPTION": "Everyone can also participate in the collection of information by taking measurements of the quality of waterways and stormwater and entering the information into the observation report. Measurements can be made with your own equipment or you can purchase equipment with instructions for use from, for example, vesireppu.com. You can view your own and others' observations from the map view.",
    "FEEDBACK_TITLE": "Feedback",
    "FEEDBACK_DESCRIPTION": "Through the feedback service, you can give feedback on the city's services, operations and decision-making.
